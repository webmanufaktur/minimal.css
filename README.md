# threes.css (aka sss.css)

*simple stupid styling CSS* should become a solid base for upcoming projects. The goal is to have all needed basics available that are needed for *simple stupid styling* tasks you would otherwise repeat each and everytime again.

## Technical details

Some details I considered while writing all this kind of classes

### Things you will need

* CSS compiler (whatever you prefer)

### Things you won't need

* JS/Javascript is not needed
* 
### Things you might want to use

* [ProcessWire](https://processwire.com/)
* [ProcessWire ProCache](https://processwire.com/store/pro-cache/)
* [Prepros](https://prepros.io/)

You can always use any tool that fits your needs. Whatever it is. It just needs to understand [.less](http://lesscss.org/).

## FAQ

**Why yet another CSS framework?**
It's not another framework. It's another tool in my tool belt. Everything within this project is based on my personal workflow to build everything from prototypes, MVPs or even stable and productive online projects. Therefore it will not everyone's projects. I guess it will only fit my workflow and projects.
