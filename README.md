# minimal.css

It's not a framework of any kind. Neither a replacement for Bootstrap, UIKIT or something like Tailwind.css. It's just a solid foundation based on 19 years of frontend development with several resets and other showstoppers.

The goal is to have all needed basics and sane defaults available that are needed for *super simple stupid styling*s of all kinds of modern websites and tasks you would otherwise repeat each and everytime again. Or at least I would repeat them each and evertime for each project again. Therefore I wrote this - for me. At least.

## Technical details

Some details I considered while writing all this kind of classes

The main details are... well... it's CSS made from .less or .sass or .scss... don't know which will be the real candidate for this at the end. No matter what wich .style it will be... you can always rewrite/convert it.

### Things you will need

* CSS compiler (whatever you prefer)

### Things you won't need

* JS/Javascript is not needed

### Things you might want to use

* [ProcessWire](https://processwire.com/)
* [ProcessWire ProCache](https://processwire.com/store/pro-cache/)
* [Prepros](https://prepros.io/)

You can always use any tool that fits your needs. Whatever it is. It just needs to understand [.less](http://lesscss.org/), [.sass](https://sass-lang.com/) or .scss.

## FAQ

**Why yet another CSS framework?**
It's not another framework. It's another tool in my tool belt. Everything within this project is based on my personal workflow to build everything from prototypes, MVPs or even stable and productive online projects. Therefore it will not be everyone's darling or everyone's tool of choice for some kind of projects. To be totally honest... I guess it will only fit somewhere in my workflow and projects.
